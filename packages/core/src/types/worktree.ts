/**
 * Git worktree - First-class entity for isolated development contexts
 *
 * Worktrees are persistent work contexts that outlive individual sessions.
 * Each worktree has:
 * - Isolated git working directory and branch
 * - Environment configuration and runtime state
 * - Work metadata (issue, PR, notes)
 * - Session history
 *
 * Relationship to sessions:
 * - Sessions = ephemeral conversations with AI agents
 * - Worktrees = persistent work contexts (git + environment + metadata)
 * - Multiple sessions can work on the same worktree over time
