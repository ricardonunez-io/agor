# Agor Context

This directory contains modular knowledge files that document Agor's concepts, architecture, and design principles. These files are designed to be:

- **Composable** - Load only what you need
- **Self-referencing** - Concepts link to related concepts
- **Version-controlled** - Track evolution of ideas over time
- **AI-friendly** - Agents can load specific concepts as context

### Explorations (Work in Progress)

Experimental ideas and designs not yet crystallized into concepts. These represent active thinking and may graduate to `concepts/` when ready:

**Future Features:**

- **[native-cli-feature-gaps.md](explorations/native-cli-feature-gaps.md)** - Feature comparison between native agent CLIs and SDK capabilities

**Orchestration & Coordination:**

- **[subtask-orchestration.md](explorations/subtask-orchestration.md)** - Multi-agent task coordination and getting agents to spawn Agor-tracked subtasks
- **[async-jobs.md](explorations/async-jobs.md)** - Background job processing, queuing strategies, and long-running task management

**Distribution & Launch:**

- **[single-package.md](explorations/single-package.md)** - Distribution strategy (bundled CLI + daemon + UI into single npm package)
- **[docs-website.md](explorations/docs-website.md)** - Documentation website with Nextra (user guides, REST API reference, MDX support)

**Onboarding & UX:**

- **[init-experience.md](explorations/init-experience.md)** - Init flow, auth checking, API key management, tool availability UI patterns

**Lifecycle:** `explorations/` → `concepts/` when design is validated and ready to be official

### Archives

Historical documentation and completed research preserved for reference:

- **[gemini-integration-research.md](archives/gemini-integration-research.md)** - Gemini CLI SDK discovery process, API analysis, and integration decisions (completed Oct 2025)

**Purpose:** Archives preserve the research journey and decision-making context for completed features. They're valuable for understanding "why" things were built certain ways.

### Primitives (Deep Dives)

Future location for detailed explorations of each primitive:

- `primitives/session.md` - Sessions in depth
- `primitives/task.md` - Tasks in depth
- `primitives/report.md` - Reports in depth
- `primitives/worktree.md` - Worktrees in depth
- `primitives/concept.md` - Concepts in depth (meta!)

## Using Context Files

### For Developers

Read concept files to understand specific aspects of Agor:

```bash
# Start with core concepts
cat context/concepts/core.md

# Then explore specific areas
cat context/concepts/architecture.md
cat context/concepts/design.md
```

### For AI Agents

Load relevant concepts into session context:

```bash
# Example: Starting a session focused on UI work
agor session start \
  --concepts design \
  --agent claude-code
```

## Contributing

When adding new concepts:

1. Create focused, single-topic files (prefer smaller over larger)
2. Use wiki-style links to reference related concepts: `[[concept-name]]`
3. Include "Related:" section at the top
4. Add entry to this README
5. Update cross-references in existing concepts

## Philosophy

> "Context engineering isn't about prompt templates—it's about managing modular knowledge as first-class composable primitives."

These concept files embody Agor's own design philosophy applied to documentation.
