# Product Messaging

**Status:** ✅ Live
**Related:** [[design]], [[worktrees]], [[agent-integration]]

---

## Positioning

- **Taglines:** “Great solo. Even better together.” / “Git tracks code, Agor tracks the conversations that produced it.”
- **Before → After:** invisible AI sessions vs. collaborative boards with forkable sessions, agent swapping, and sharable environments.
- **Metaphors:** Trello-style spatial boards for AI work, multiplayer RTS coordination, “making invisible agent work visible.”

## Visual Storytelling

Use imagery that mixes multiplayer boards + live cursors, session drawers with task breakdowns, and zone workflows (`Analyze → Develop → Review → Deploy`).

## Hero Diagram

```
Your IDE (VS Code / Cursor)
        ↓
  Agor Daemon ← Git Worktrees + LibSQL
        ↓
Agent SDKs (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
```

## Quick Examples

- Highlight parallel worktrees (e.g., auth on Claude, payments on Codex, analytics on Gemini) with running URLs.
- Show session forking, environment sharing, and zone triggers to communicate orchestration.
