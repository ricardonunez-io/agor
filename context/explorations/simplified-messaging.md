# Simplified Messaging

## Current Recommendation

**Tagline:**

> A visual, collaborative UX for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode

**Subtitle:**

> Organize work on spatial boards. Let supervisor agents coordinate the swarm. Automate with zones, extend with APIs. Solo-first, multiplayer-ready.

## Key Insights

### The Category Problem

There's no clean category name for "Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode" yet:

- "AI coding tools" → too broad (includes Copilot, Cursor)
- "Agentic coding tools" → insider jargon
- "AI coding CLIs" → closest but still not widely recognized

**Solution:** Name the tools directly. The enumeration IS the category.

### What Resonates

| Word/Phrase                 | Why It Works                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **visual**                  | Core unlock — these tools are invisible today, Agor makes them seeable |
| **collaborative**           | Team play without forcing it                                           |
| **UX**                      | Less bounded than "UI", implies the whole experience                   |
| **platform**                | Signals depth (CLI, client, APIs) without listing them                 |
| **Great solo. Team-ready.** | Validates solo users, teases team play                                 |

### What to Avoid

| Word/Phrase           | Why It's Risky                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| "The best"            | Not humble, let the product prove it      |
| "Next-gen"            | Vague, what gen are CLIs?                 |
| "Spatial layer"       | Cool but not relatable                    |
| "Multiplayer"         | Sounds like a toy                         |
| "Agent orchestration" | World might not be ready for this framing |
| "Workspace"           | Overused, undersells it                   |

## Evolution of Thinking

Started with:

> "Next-gen agent orchestration for AI coding"

Problems:

- "Agent orchestration" too abstract
- "Next-gen" vague
- Doesn't name the actual tools

Evolved to:

> "The multiplayer-ready, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool"

Problems:

- "Multiplayer" sounds toy-like
- "Spatial layer" confusing
- Too long

Final:

> "A visual, collaborative UX for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode"

Why it works:

- **Visual** — the core value prop (finally SEE sessions)
- **Collaborative** — team play implied, not forced
- **Names the tools** — searchable, precise, credible
- **UX** — comprehensive, not just a viewer

## The 5 Breakthroughs

The subtitle should touch on all 5 core differentiators:

| #   | Breakthrough                                                    | How We Cover It                                 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Multi-agent** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode)      | ✅ Tagline names all 4 tools directly           |
| 2   | **Spatial canvas** / spatial memory                             | ✅ "Organize work on spatial boards"            |
| 3   | **Multiplayer**                                                 | ✅ "multiplayer-ready"                          |
| 4   | **Internal MCP** / supervisor agents / cross-agent coordination | ✅ "Let supervisor agents coordinate the swarm" |
| 5   | **Platform** (API, TypeScript client, MCP, socket events)       | ✅ "Automate with zones, extend with APIs"      |

## Subtitle Options Considered

**v1 - Platform + orchestration:**

> A collaborative platform to run, visualize, and orchestrate AI coding sessions — CLI, visual client, and APIs included.

**v2 - Solo-first, scale implied:**

> A visual platform to run and orchestrate AI coding agents. Bring your team when you're ready.

**v3 - Minimal:**

> A visual platform to orchestrate AI coding agents. Great solo. Team-ready.

**v4 - Hit all 5 explicitly:**

> Spatial boards that tap into visual memory. Agents that spawn and supervise other agents. A full platform: CLI, TypeScript client, MCP, real-time events. Great solo. Team-ready.

**v5 - Lead with supervisor magic:**

> Agents that can see the whole board and spawn other agents. Spatial zones with prompt automation. Built as a platform from day one — CLI, TypeScript client, and APIs included.

**v6 - Poetic, less listy (winner):**

> Organize work on spatial boards. Let supervisor agents coordinate the swarm. Automate with zones, extend with APIs. Solo-first, multiplayer-ready.

**v7 - Punchy bullet style:**

> Spatial boards. Supervisor agents. Zone automation. Full platform APIs. Great solo. Team-ready.

## Future Considerations

- **Workflow/automation** — Could hint at kanban/boards: "...on boards" or "from backlog to shipped"
- **"Orchestrate armies"** — Fun but maybe too aggressive for first impression
- **Category emergence** — If "agentic CLIs" becomes a thing, could simplify the tagline
