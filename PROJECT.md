  - Remote cursors visible in canvas and minimap
  - Smooth position transitions with timestamp-based ordering
- ✅ **MCP server integration** - Phase 1-2 complete
  - Database schema + repositories + services
  - MCPServersTable UI with full CRUD
  - MCPServerSelect for session-level selection
  - CLI commands: `agor mcp add/list/show/remove`
- ✅ **Claude Agent SDK** - Live session execution with streaming
- ✅ **OpenAI Codex SDK** - Beta integration with permission modes

### Phase 3: Collaboration & Orchestration

**Goal:** Complete fork/spawn workflow and advanced presence features.

**Orchestration (2-3 weeks):**

- [ ] **Session forking UI** - Fork sessions at decision points
  - Wire fork button to `/sessions/:id/fork` API
  - Display fork genealogy on canvas (React Flow edges)
  - Show fork point in conversation view

- [ ] **Genealogy visualization** - Show session relationships
  - React Flow edges between parent/child/forked sessions
  - Different edge styles (solid spawn, dashed fork)
  - Click edge to see fork/spawn context

**Presence indicators (1-2 weeks):**

- [ ] **Session viewers** - Who's viewing which sessions
  - `viewing:session` events
  - Mini avatar badges on session cards
  - Tooltip showing viewer names

- [ ] **Typing indicators** - Who's prompting
  - `typing:start` / `typing:stop` events
  - "User is typing..." below prompt input

**MCP Phase 3 (2-3 weeks):**

- [ ] **SDK integration** - Pass MCP servers to agent
  - Convert Agor configs to SDK format
  - Enable agents to use configured MCP tools
- [ ] **Import/export** - Auto-discover `.mcp.json` from Claude Code
- [ ] **Testing & discovery** - Verify connectivity, auto-detect capabilities

### Phase 4: Distribution & Packaging (Q2-Q4 2025)

**Goal:** Make Agor easy to install and use for non-developers.

See [context/explorations/single-package.md](context/explorations/single-package.md) for complete distribution strategy.

**Phase 4a: Quick npm Release (Q2 2025) - 1-2 weeks**

- [ ] Publish `@agor/core` to npm
- [ ] Publish `@agor/daemon` to npm
- [ ] Publish `@agor/cli` to npm
- [ ] Update README with npm install instructions
- [ ] Document daemon setup separately

**Phase 4b: Bundled Experience (Q3 2025) - 2-4 weeks**

- [ ] Bundle daemon into CLI package
- [ ] Implement auto-start daemon on CLI commands
- [ ] Add `agor daemon` lifecycle commands (start/stop/status/logs)
- [ ] Publish `agor` meta-package
- [ ] Update README with simplified instructions

**Phase 4c: Desktop Application (Q4 2025) - 6-8 weeks**

- [ ] Choose framework: Tauri (recommended) or Electron
- [ ] Embed daemon as Tauri sidecar
- [ ] Build native installers (macOS .dmg, Windows .exe, Linux .deb)
- [ ] Add system tray integration
- [ ] Publish to Homebrew, winget, apt repositories
- [ ] Implement native auto-update mechanism

### Future (Phase 5+)

See [context/explorations/](context/explorations/) for detailed designs:

- **OAuth & organizations** - GitHub/Google login, team workspaces, RBAC
- **Multi-agent support** ([agent-integration.md](context/concepts/agent-integration.md)) - Cursor, Gemini
- **Cloud deployment** - PostgreSQL migration, Turso/Supabase, hosted version
- **Worktree UX** ([worktree-ux-design.md](context/explorations/worktree-ux-design.md)) - Git worktree management UI

---

# Critical Path

**Agent Integration:**

- ✅ Claude Agent SDK - live execution with streaming
- ✅ Codex SDK - beta integration with permission modes
- ⏳ **Improve Codex SDK integration** - test/refine permission handling, tool uses
- [ ] **Get Gemini to work** - integrate Gemini SDK similar to Claude/Codex

**Information Architecture:**

- ⏳ **Git state tracking** - attach proper git sha to tasks (latest commit when created, mark -dirty)
- ⏳ **Concepts & Reports** - integrate in UI/CLI as first-class primitives
  - Concept management (CRUD/CLI) - many-to-many per session, shows as readonly
  - Report management + production system

**Tool Visualization:**

- ✅ Task-centric conversation UI
- ✅ Tool blocks with semantic grouping
- ⏳ **Improve tool blocks** - better Storybook coverage for common tools
- ⏳ **Todo tool visualization** - render task list with checkboxes
- ⏳ **Write (diff) tool** - show file changes with syntax highlighting

**Distribution:**

- [ ] **Doc website** - Nextra-based documentation site (see [docs-website.md](context/explorations/docs-website.md))
  - User guides (getting started, features, workflows)
  - Auto-generated REST API docs (OpenAPI)
  - CLI reference (oclif self-documenting)
  - Architecture docs (adapted from concepts/)
  - Deploy to docs.agor.dev (Vercel)

# Nice to Have

- ✅ PR/Issue URL fields in session metadata
- [ ] **Token count & cost** - show $ per task/session (when applicable)
- [ ] **`@`-triggered autocomplete** - mention sessions, repos, concepts
- [ ] **Session viewers** - mini avatar badges on cards showing who's viewing
- [ ] **Typing indicators** - "User is typing..." in prompt input
