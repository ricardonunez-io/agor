# agor

**Think Figma, but for AI coding assistants.**

**Next-gen agent orchestration for AI coding.** The multiplayer-ready, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool into one unified workspace.

> **TL;DR:** Agor is a multiplayer spatial canvas where you coordinate multiple AI coding assistants on parallel tasks, with GitHub-linked worktrees, automated workflow zones, and isolated test environments—all running simultaneously.

Visualize, coordinate, and automate your AI workflows across tools solo or with your team.
Agor offers a place where you can coordinate entire swarms of AI agents.

## Key Features

### 🧩 Agent Swarm Control

- Run as many **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Gemini** sessions as you can handle—simultaneously.
- Agents in Agor can coordinate and supervise through the internal Agor MCP service.
- Built-in **scheduler** triggers templated prompts on your cadence.

### 🌐 Multiplayer Spatial Canvas

- Figma-esque board layout organizes your AI coding sessions across boards (full 2D canvases).
- **Scoped/spatial comments** + reactions pinned to boards, zones, or worktrees (Figma-style).
- WebSocket-powered cursor broadcasting and facepiles show teammates in real time.

### 🌲 Session Trees — Fork, Spawn, Coordinate

- **Fork sessions** to explore alternatives without losing the original path.
- **Spawn subsessions** for focused subtasks that report back to the parent.
- Visualize the session genealogy in "session trees"

### ⚙️ Zone Triggers — Workflows Made Spatial

- Define **zones** on your board that trigger templated prompts when worktrees are dropped.
- Build **kanban-style flows** or custom pipelines: analyze → develop → review → deploy.
- **GitHub-native workflow**: Link worktrees to issues/PRs, auto-inject context into prompts
  - Template syntax: `"deeply analyze this github issue: {{ worktree.issue_url }}"`
  - Each worktree = isolated branch for a specific issue/PR
  - AI agents automatically read the linked issue/PR context

### 🌳 Isolated Development Environments

**The Problem:** Working on 3 PRs simultaneously? Each needs different ports, dependencies, database states.

**Agor's Solution:**

- Each worktree gets its own **isolated environment** with auto-managed unique ports
- Configure start/stop commands once with templates: `PORT={{ add 9000 worktree.unique_id }} docker compose up -d`
- Everyone on your team can **one-click start/stop** any worktree's environment
- Multiple AI agents work in parallel without stepping on each other
- Health monitoring tracks if services are running properly

**No more:** "Kill your local server, I need to test my branch"

### 🕹️ Real-Time Strategy for AI Teams

- Coordinate agentic work like a multiplayer RTS.
- Watch teammates or agents move across tasks live.
- Cluster sessions, delegate, pivot, and iterate together.

### 📱 Mobile-Friendly Prompting

- **Keep sessions cooking on the go** — mobile-optimized UI for sending prompts and monitoring progress.
- Access conversations, send follow-ups, and check agent status from your phone.
- Full conversation view with hamburger navigation to switch between sessions.

## Use Case: Parallel PR Workflow

Your team has 3 bug fixes and 2 features in flight. With Agor:

1. **Create 5 worktrees**, each linked to its GitHub issue/PR
2. **Spawn AI sessions** for each worktree (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
3. **Drop into zones** → "Analyze" zone triggers: `"Review this issue: {{ worktree.issue_url }}"`
4. **Watch in real-time** as all 5 agents work simultaneously on the spatial canvas
5. **Isolated environments** with unique ports prevent conflicts
6. **Push directly** from worktrees to GitHub when ready

**No context switching. No port collisions. No waiting.**

## Roadmap

**[Full roadmap](https://github.com/preset-io/agor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aroadmap)**

Highlights:

- **Match CLI-Native Features** — SDKs are evolving rapidly and exposing more functionality. Our goal is to push integrations deeper to match all key features available in the underlying CLIs, closing the gap between SDK-based orchestration and native tool capabilities
- **Bring Your Own IDE** — Connect VSCode, Cursor, or any IDE directly to Agor-managed worktrees via SSH/Remote. Keep your familiar editor and agent while Agor orchestrates sessions, tracks progress, and enables team visibility on the multiplayer board
- **Unix User Integration** — Enable true multi-tenancy with per-user Unix isolation for secure collaboration. [Read the exploration →](https://github.com/preset-io/agor/blob/main/context/explorations/unix-user-integration.md)
