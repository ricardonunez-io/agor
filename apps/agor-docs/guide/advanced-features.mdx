# Advanced Features

Power-user features to enhance your AI coding workflow. An image is worth a thousand words, so let's show you what's possible.

---

## 🎯 Worktree Highlighting

**Never miss when an agent finishes working.** Worktree cards pulse with a teal glow when sessions are ready for your attention.

## 🔴 Favicon Status Indicator

**See session activity at a glance, even in background tabs.** Your browser tab's favicon updates with status dots to show real-time activity:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Frame caption="⚪ Agent working">
    <img
      src="/public/screenshots/favicon-white-dot.png"
      alt="White dot lower-left: agent working"
      width="48"
      height="48"
    />
  </Frame>
  <Frame caption="🟢 Ready for prompt">
    <img
      src="/public/screenshots/favicon-green-dot.png"
      alt="Green dot lower-right: ready for prompt"
      width="48"
      height="48"
    />
  </Frame>
  <Frame caption="⚪🟢 Both states">
    <img
      src="/public/screenshots/favicon-both.png"
      alt="Both dots: working + ready"
      width="48"
      height="48"
    />
  </Frame>
</Columns>

Dots appear independently: white (lower-left) for running agents, green (lower-right) for ready sessions. Both can show simultaneously. Updates in real-time via WebSocket.

## 🔔 Task Completion Chimes

**Hear when your agents finish working.** Set up audio notifications for long-running tasks so you can multitask.

## 📊 Context Window Progression

**See exactly how much context you're using.** Color-coded underlays show token consumption as you work through conversations.

<Frame>

## ✅ Task Tracking

**Track your progress with interactive todo lists.** Claude Code agents automatically create and update task lists as they work.

## 📝 Message Queueing

**Queue up multiple prompts while an agent is working.** Send follow-up instructions without interrupting the current task.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/public/screenshots/queued%20messages.png"
    alt="Queued messages in conversation"
    width="400"
  />
</Frame>

---

## 🔍 Per-Message Git Tracking

**See exactly what changed with each agent message.** Every message tracks git diffs, showing which files were modified and what changed.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/public/screenshots/git-state-changes.png"
    alt="Git changes tracked per message"
    width="400"
  />
</Frame>

## 💬 Autocomplete

**Quickly reference files and users with @ mentions.** Type @ to autocomplete file paths and user names in your prompts.

    alt="File autocomplete in prompt input"
    width="400"

## 🎨 Streamdown Markdown Rendering

**Rich AI responses with live streaming.** Agor uses [Streamdown](https://github.com/vercel/streamdown) by Vercel to render AI-generated markdown in real-time.

### What You Get

- **Mermaid diagrams** - Stream flowcharts and sequence diagrams with one-click rendering
- **Math expressions** - LaTeX/KaTeX support for inline ($E = mc^2$) and block equations
- **Syntax highlighting** - 100+ languages via Shiki (server-side)
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** - Tables, task lists, strikethrough, and more
- **Streaming-optimized** - Handles incomplete chunks gracefully during real-time delivery

## 🗄️ Worktree Archival

**Clean up your workspace without losing valuable data.** Archive completed worktrees to preserve conversation history, analytics, and metadata while keeping your board clutter-free.

### The Smart Way to Clean Up

When a PR is merged or feature is complete, you often want to clean up disk space but keep:

- Session conversation history for learning/analytics
- Issue and PR associations for project tracking
- Environment configurations for future reference
- Metadata for team insights and cost attribution

### Archive Options

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/public/screenshots/archive-worktree.png"
    alt="Archive or Delete Worktree modal showing filesystem and metadata options"
    width="400"
  />
</Frame>

**Filesystem:**

- **Leave untouched** - No changes to disk (metadata-only archival)
- **Clean workspace** - Runs `git clean -fdx` (removes node_modules, builds, untracked files)
- **Delete completely** - Removes entire worktree directory from disk

**Metadata & Sessions:**

- **Archive (recommended)** - Hides from board, preserves all data for analytics and history
- **Delete permanently** - Removes all data including sessions and conversations (no undo)

**Best Practice:** Archive with filesystem cleanup after PR merge. Only delete permanently for experimental worktrees with no valuable data.

## 👥 Multiplayer Terminal Sessions

**Collaborate in real-time via shared tmux sessions.** When multiple users open the same worktree terminal, they see each other's keystrokes live.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/public/screenshots/tmux.png"
    alt="Terminal showing multiplayer tmux session with collaborative commands"
    width="400"
  />
</Frame>

### How It Works

- Each worktree gets a dedicated tmux window in the shared `agor` session
- Multiple users connecting to the same worktree attach to the same window
- WebSocket broadcasting ensures all keystrokes and output are synchronized
- No configuration needed - works automatically when tmux is installed

### Use Cases

- **Pair programming** - Two developers working on the same feature in sync
- **Live debugging** - One person navigating terminal while another observes
- **Onboarding** - Senior dev demonstrates commands while junior follows along
- **Code review** - Reviewer can explore the worktree interactively during review

**Privacy Note:** Terminal sessions are worktree-scoped. Users only see terminals for worktrees they're actively using.

## 🤖 Spawned Subsessions with Callbacks

**Delegate work to specialized subagents that report back when finished.**

Agor's subsessions enable powerful multi-agent orchestration:

- **Non-blocking** - Parent remains responsive while subsessions work
- **Multi-tool support** - Use Claude, Codex, Gemini, or OpenCode
- **Fully introspectable** - Complete conversation and git history
- **Hierarchical** - Children can spawn their own subsessions

This feature unlocks capabilities not available in native agent SDKs, including subsession support for Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode.
