# Agor

**Next-gen agent orchestration for AI-assisted development.**

_The multiplayer, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool into one unified workspace._

<Callout type="info">
  **Early Beta** - Agor is in active development. Expect rapid changes and improvements.

A platform for **real-time, multiplayer agentic development**.
Visualize, coordinate, and automate your AI workflows across tools.
Agor turns every AI session into a composable, inspectable, and reusable building block.

## 🚀 Try Agor (No Installation Required)

  **Note:** Early beta, ephemeral data (lost on rebuild), Codespaces free tier: 60 hours/month ([check usage](https://github.com/settings/billing))
</Callout>

**Getting Started:**

1. Click badge above → Services auto-start (~10-20s)
2. Open forwarded port 5173 (UI) in browser

## 🚀 What Makes Agor Different

### 🧩 Agent Orchestration Layer

- Integrates with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and soon **Gemini**, via an extensible SDK.
- Centralized **MCP configuration** — connect once, use across all tools.
- Swap or parallelize agents with one command; easily hand off work when one model stalls.

### 🌐 Multiplayer Spatial Canvas

- Real-time collaboration with **cursor broadcasting** and **facepiles**.
- Sessions live on a **dynamic board** — cluster by project, phase, or purpose.
- Visualize your full session tree: forks, spawns, subtasks, and outcomes.

### 🧠 Context-Aware Development

- Manage deliberate context via `context/` folder of markdown files.
- Dynamically load modular context blocks per session.
- Keep every agent's worldview focused and version-controlled.

### 🔀 Native Session Forking & Subtask Forcing

- **Fork** any session to explore alternative approaches, preserving full ancestry.
- **Spawn** a subtask: Agor automatically creates a new session with a fresh context window.
- Subtasks are introspectable, reusable, and linked in the session genealogy.

### ⚙️ Zone Triggers — Workflows Made Spatial

- Define **zones** on your board that trigger templated prompts when sessions are dropped.
- Build **kanban-style flows** or custom pipelines: analyze → develop → review → deploy.
- Combine with context templates to automate arbitrarily complex workflows.

### 🌳 Git Worktree Management + Lightweight Environments

- Every session maps to an isolated **git worktree** — no branch conflicts.
- **One-click environment control** from the UI — configure start/stop commands, health endpoints, and URLs per repo.
- Automatic **port management** (each worktree gets unique ports) and **health monitoring** with status indicators.
- Run **multiple feature branches in parallel** with their own running apps (e.g., feature/auth on :4000, feature/payments on :5000).
- Works with any stack: `docker compose up`, `npm run dev`, `./manage.py runserver` — just configure in UI once.
- **Shared environments** across sessions on the same worktree — multiple agents collaborating on running code.
- **Visual status tracking** — see which environments are running, stopped, or unhealthy at a glance.

### 🕹️ Real-Time Strategy for AI Teams

- Coordinate agentic work like a multiplayer RTS.
- Watch teammates or agents move across tasks live.
- Cluster sessions, delegate, pivot, and iterate together.

---

## 💡 What You Can Build

- **Collaborative AI development boards** shared by teams.
- **A/B testing frameworks** comparing agent outputs across tools.
- **Parallel feature development** with isolated environments per branch.
- **Custom "zone-triggered" automation flows**, from idea to deployment.
- **Knowledge maps** of all AI interactions across projects.
- **Cross-agent orchestration** for hybrid Claude–Codex–Gemini workflows.

### Example: Multi-Feature Parallel Development

```bash
# Worktree 1: feature/auth (Claude Code)
Environment: http://localhost:4000
Sessions: 2 (one for frontend, one for backend)

# Worktree 2: feature/payments (Codex)
Environment: http://localhost:5000
Sessions: 1 (Stripe integration)

# Worktree 3: feature/analytics (Gemini)
Environment: http://localhost:6000
Sessions: 1 (dashboard implementation)
```

All running simultaneously, each with their own isolated code + environment, orchestrated from one Agor board.
