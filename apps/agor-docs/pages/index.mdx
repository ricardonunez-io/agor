# Agor

**Next-gen agent orchestration for AI-assisted development.**

_The multiplayer-ready, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool into one unified workspace._

A platform for **real-time, multiplayer-ready agentic development**.
Visualize, coordinate, and automate your AI workflows across tools solo or with your team.
Agor offers a place where you can coordinate entire swarms of AI agents.

## Getting Started

**Try in GitHub Codespaces (fastest):**

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/mistercrunch/agor?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fplayground%2Fdevcontainer.json)

**Or run locally with Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up
# Visit http://localhost:5173 → Login: admin@agor.live / admin
```

See the [Docker Guide](/guide/docker) and [Development Guide](/guide/development) for more details.

## What Makes Agor Different

### 🧩 Agent Orchestration Layer

- Integrates with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Gemini** via an extensible SDK.
- Centralized **MCP configuration** — connect once, use across all tools.
- Swap or parallelize agents with one command; easily hand off work when one model stalls.

### 🌐 Multiplayer Spatial Canvas

- Real-time collaboration with **cursor broadcasting** and **facepiles**.
- Sessions live on a **dynamic board** — cluster by project, phase, or purpose.
- Visualize your full session tree: forks, spawns, subtasks, and outcomes.

### ⚙️ Zone Triggers — Workflows Made Spatial

- Define **zones** on your board that trigger templated prompts when sessions are dropped.
- Build **kanban-style flows** or custom pipelines: analyze → develop → review → deploy.
- Combine with context templates to automate arbitrarily complex workflows.

### 🌳 Git Worktree Management + Lightweight Environments

- Every session maps to an isolated **git worktree** — no branch conflicts.
- **One-click environment control** from the UI — configure start/stop commands, health endpoints, and URLs per repo.
- Automatic **port management** (each worktree gets unique ports) and **health monitoring** with status indicators.
- Run **multiple feature branches in parallel** with their own running apps (e.g., feature/auth on :4000, feature/payments on :5000).
- Works with any stack: `docker compose up`, `npm run dev`, `./manage.py runserver` — just configure in UI once.
- **Shared environments** across sessions on the same worktree — multiple agents collaborating on running code.
- **Visual status tracking** — see which environments are running, stopped, or unhealthy at a glance.

### 🕹️ Real-Time Strategy for AI Teams

- Coordinate agentic work like a multiplayer RTS.
- Watch teammates or agents move across tasks live.
- Cluster sessions, delegate, pivot, and iterate together.

## Roadmap

- **Match CLI-Native Features** — SDKs are evolving rapidly and exposing more functionality. Our goal is to push integrations deeper to match all key features available in the underlying CLIs, closing the gap between SDK-based orchestration and native tool capabilities
- **Bring Your Own IDE** — Connect VSCode, Cursor, or any IDE directly to Agor-managed worktrees via SSH/Remote. Keep your familiar editor and agent while Agor orchestrates sessions, tracks progress, and enables team visibility on the multiplayer board
- **Session Forking & Subtask Spawning** — Fork sessions to explore alternative approaches or spawn subtasks with fresh context windows, all with full genealogy tracking and interactive visualization
- **Automated Reports** — AI-generated summaries after task completion, capturing outcomes, decisions made, and artifacts produced for future reference
- **Context Management System** — Modular markdown-based context files that compose into session-specific knowledge, keeping every agent's worldview focused and version-controlled
