# Getting Started

Get Agor running and create your first AI coding session in under 5 minutes.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agor-live
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize (creates ~/.agor/ and database)
agor init

# 2. Start the daemon
agor daemon start

# 3. Open the UI
agor open
```

**That's it!** Now follow the steps below to start your first AI coding session.

**Try in GitHub Codespaces (up in 1-2 minutes):**

## Step 1: Link a Code Repository

Before you can create AI sessions, Agor needs to know about your code repositories.

### Add a Local Repository

If you have a git repository on your machine:

**Via UI:**

1. Open Agor (`agor open`)
2. Click **Settings** (⚙️ icon in header)
3. Go to **Repos** tab
4. Click **Add Repository**
5. Enter the absolute path to your repo (e.g., `/Users/you/projects/myapp`)

**Via CLI:**

```bash
agor repo add /path/to/your/repo
```

### Add a Remote Repository

Agor can clone remote repositories for you:

**Via UI:**

1. Open Settings → Repos
2. Click **Add Repository**
3. Enter the git URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo.git`)
4. Agor will clone it to `~/.agor/repos/<repo-name>`

**Via CLI:**

```bash
agor repo add https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Worktree

**What's a worktree?** A worktree is an isolated working directory for your repository - think of it as checking out a branch in a separate location. This lets you work on multiple features simultaneously without switching branches or stashing changes.

[Learn more about worktrees →](/guide/concepts#worktrees)

### Why Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to have multiple branches checked out at once in different places on your filesystem. In Agor:

- **1 worktree = 1 issue = 1 PR = 1 feature**
- Each worktree contains a tree of AI sessions working on that feature
- Completely isolated - changes in one don't affect others

### Create a Worktree

**Via UI:**

1. Click **New Worktree** button (+ icon near top)
2. Choose your repository
3. Pick a name (like you would for a branch - e.g., `auth-feature`, `fix-bug-123`)
4. Optionally:
   - Create a new branch or checkout existing one
   - Link to an issue URL or PR URL
   - Add notes about what you're working on

<img src="/screenshots/new-worktree.png" alt="Create New Worktree Dialog" width="400px" />

**Via CLI:**

```bash
# Create worktree with new branch
agor worktree create my-repo feature-name

# Create from existing branch
agor worktree create my-repo feature-name --branch existing-branch

# Link to issue
agor worktree create my-repo feature-name --issue https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123
```

Your worktree will be created at `~/.agor/worktrees/<repo>/<name>`

---

## Step 3: Authenticate with AI Providers

Agor supports multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode). To use them, you need to authenticate.

### Authentication Options

Agor offers **three ways** to configure AI credentials, in order of priority:

#### Option 1: CLI Login (Recommended for Claude)

The fastest way to get started with Claude Code:

```bash
claude login
```

This stores your credentials in `~/.claude/` and Agor automatically detects them.

#### Option 2: Per-User API Keys (Recommended for Teams)

Store encrypted API keys in Agor, scoped to your user account:

**Via UI:**

1. Open **Settings** → **Agentic Tools** tab
2. Enter your API keys:
   - **Anthropic API Key** for Claude Code
   - **OpenAI API Key** for Codex
   - **Google AI API Key** for Gemini
3. Click **Save**

<img src="/screenshots/configure-agentic-tools.png" alt="Configure Agentic Tools" width="400px" />

Your keys are:

- ✅ Encrypted at rest in the database
- ✅ Only visible to you (per-user scope)
- ✅ Automatically used by all your sessions

**Get API Keys:**

- Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Google AI: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

#### Option 3: Environment Variables (Global Fallback)

Set environment variables that all users can access (workspace-level):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="..."
```

**Via UI (Global Settings):**

1. Open **Settings** → **Environment Variables** tab
2. Add variables for your workspace

**Note:** Environment variables are visible to all users in your Agor instance.

### How Authentication Priority Works

When you start a session, Agor checks for credentials in this order:

1. **Per-user API keys** (if set in Settings → Agentic Tools)
2. **`claude login` credentials** (if you ran `claude login`)
3. **Environment variables** (global fallback)

This lets you mix approaches - use `claude login` for yourself while teammates use per-user keys.

## Step 4: Start Your First AI Session

Now you're ready to create an AI coding session!

**Via UI:**

1. Find your worktree card on the board
2. Click **New Session** (+ icon on the worktree card)
3. Choose your agentic tool (Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini)
4. Optionally configure:
   - Model selection
   - Permission mode (auto-approve tools, ask before each, etc.)
   - MCP servers
5. Click **Create**

**Via CLI:**

```bash
# Create session in your worktree
agor session create <worktree-id> --tool claude-code

# Or use interactive mode
agor session create <worktree-id> --interactive
```

### Send Your First Prompt

Once the session is created:

1. Click on the session to open the conversation view
2. Type your prompt (e.g., "Add a login form to the app")
3. Hit **Enter** or click **Send**

Watch as the AI agent:

- Reads your code
- Plans changes
- Edits files
- Runs tests
- Reports back to you

All tool calls, file edits, and command outputs are streamed in real-time!

## What's Next?

Now that you have your first session running:

- **[Concepts](/guide/concepts)** - Deep dive into worktrees, boards, sessions, and environments
- **[Advanced Features](/guide/advanced-features)** - Zones, subsessions, schedulers, and more
- **[Architecture](/guide/architecture)** - System design and internals
- **[Development Guide](/guide/development)** - Contributing to Agor

**Pro Tips:**

- Use **zones** on your board to automate workflows (drag worktree to "Ready for Review" → auto-prompt for code review)
- **Fork sessions** to try different approaches to the same problem
- **Spawn subsessions** to delegate subtasks to child agents
- Check the **environment status** to see if your dev server is running

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3030 already in use

```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:3030 | xargs kill -9

# Or configure a different port
agor config set daemon.port 4030
agor daemon start
```

### Daemon not starting

```bash
# Check daemon status
agor daemon status

# View logs
agor daemon logs

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3030/health
```

### Can't connect to daemon

Make sure the daemon is running:

```bash
agor daemon status
# If not running:
agor daemon start
```
