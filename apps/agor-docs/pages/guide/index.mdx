# agor

**Next-gen agent orchestration for AI coding.**

_The multiplayer-ready, spatial layer that connects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and any agentic coding tool into one unified workspace._

A platform for **real-time, multiplayer-ready agentic development**.
Visualize, coordinate, and automate your AI workflows across tools solo or with your team.
Agor offers a place where you can coordinate entire swarms of AI agents.

## Key Features

### 🧩 Agent Orchestration Layer

- Integrates with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Gemini** via an extensible SDK.
- Centralized **MCP configuration** — connect once, use across all tools.
- Swap or parallelize agents with one command; easily hand off work when one model stalls.

### 🌐 Multiplayer Spatial Canvas

- Real-time collaboration with **cursor broadcasting** and **facepiles**.
- Sessions live on a **dynamic board** — cluster by project, phase, or purpose.

### 🌲 Session Trees — Fork, Spawn, Coordinate

- **Fork sessions** to explore alternatives without losing the original path.
- **Spawn subsessions** for focused subtasks that report back to the parent.
- Visualize the full genealogy — see how work branched, merged, and evolved.
- Track outcomes across the tree to understand what approaches worked.

### 💬 Spatial Comments & Team Discussion

- **Threaded conversations** directly on the board — discuss plans, review outcomes, coordinate work.
- **Spatial pins** on canvas for location-specific discussions (Figma-style).
- Click a pin to highlight and scroll to the thread; hover for temporary preview.
- **Emoji reactions** for quick feedback; resolve threads when decisions are made.
- Real-time sync — see team comments appear as they're posted.

### ⚙️ Zone Triggers — Workflows Made Spatial

- Define **zones** on your board that trigger templated prompts when sessions are dropped.
- Build **kanban-style flows** or custom pipelines: analyze → develop → review → deploy.
- Combine with context templates to automate arbitrarily complex workflows.

### 🌳 Shared, Persisted Dev Environments

- **No more local environment juggling** — managed **git worktrees** with shared, persistent dev environments.
- Sessions map to worktrees with running apps, auto-managed ports, and health monitoring.
- **One-click control** — configure start/stop commands once, everyone on the team can use it.
- Works with any stack: `docker compose up`, `npm run dev`, `./manage.py runserver`.

### 🕹️ Real-Time Strategy for AI Teams

- Coordinate agentic work like a multiplayer RTS.
- Watch teammates or agents move across tasks live.
- Cluster sessions, delegate, pivot, and iterate together.

## Roadmap

**[Full roadmap](https://github.com/mistercrunch/agor/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aroadmap)**

Highlights:

- **Match CLI-Native Features** — SDKs are evolving rapidly and exposing more functionality. Our goal is to push integrations deeper to match all key features available in the underlying CLIs, closing the gap between SDK-based orchestration and native tool capabilities
- **Bring Your Own IDE** — Connect VSCode, Cursor, or any IDE directly to Agor-managed worktrees via SSH/Remote. Keep your familiar editor and agent while Agor orchestrates sessions, tracks progress, and enables team visibility on the multiplayer board
- **Automated Reports** — AI-generated summaries after task completion, capturing outcomes, decisions made, and artifacts produced for future reference
- **Context Management System** — Modular markdown-based context files that compose into session-specific knowledge, keeping every agent's worldview focused and version-controlled
