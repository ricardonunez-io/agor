# Advanced Features

Power-user features to enhance your AI coding workflow. An image is worth a thousand words, so let's show you what's possible.

---

## 🎯 Worktree Highlighting

**Never miss when an agent finishes working.** Worktree cards pulse with a teal glow when sessions are ready for your attention.

---

## 🔔 Task Completion Chimes

**Hear when your agents finish working.** Set up audio notifications for long-running tasks so you can multitask.

---

## 📊 Context Window Progression

**See exactly how much context you're using.** Color-coded underlays show token consumption as you work through conversations.

---

## ✅ Task Tracking

**Track your progress with interactive todo lists.** Claude Code agents automatically create and update task lists as they work.

---

## 📝 Message Queueing

**Queue up multiple prompts while an agent is working.** Send follow-up instructions without interrupting the current task.

---

## 🔍 Per-Message Git Tracking

**See exactly what changed with each agent message.** Every message tracks git diffs, showing which files were modified and what changed.

---

## 💬 Autocomplete

**Quickly reference files and users with @ mentions.** Type @ to autocomplete file paths and user names in your prompts.

## 🎨 Streamdown Markdown Rendering

**Rich AI responses with live streaming.** Agor uses [Streamdown](https://github.com/vercel/streamdown) by Vercel to render AI-generated markdown in real-time.

### What You Get

- **Mermaid diagrams** - Stream flowcharts and sequence diagrams with one-click rendering
- **Math expressions** - LaTeX/KaTeX support for inline ($E = mc^2$) and block equations
- **Syntax highlighting** - 100+ languages via Shiki (server-side)
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** - Tables, task lists, strikethrough, and more
- **Streaming-optimized** - Handles incomplete chunks gracefully during real-time delivery

## 🗄️ Worktree Archival

**Clean up your workspace without losing valuable data.** Archive completed worktrees to preserve conversation history, analytics, and metadata while keeping your board clutter-free.

### The Smart Way to Clean Up

When a PR is merged or feature is complete, you often want to clean up disk space but keep:
- Session conversation history for learning/analytics
- Issue and PR associations for project tracking
- Environment configurations for future reference
- Metadata for team insights and cost attribution

### Archive Options

<img src="/screenshots/archive-worktree.png" alt="Archive or Delete Worktree modal showing filesystem and metadata options" style={{maxWidth: '600px'}} />

**Filesystem:**
- **Leave untouched** - No changes to disk (metadata-only archival)
- **Clean workspace** - Runs `git clean -fdx` (removes node_modules, builds, untracked files)
- **Delete completely** - Removes entire worktree directory from disk

**Metadata & Sessions:**
- **Archive (recommended)** - Hides from board, preserves all data for analytics and history
- **Delete permanently** - Removes all data including sessions and conversations (no undo)

**Best Practice:** Archive with filesystem cleanup after PR merge. Only delete permanently for experimental worktrees with no valuable data.

## 👥 Multiplayer Terminal Sessions

**Collaborate in real-time via shared tmux sessions.** When multiple users open the same worktree terminal, they see each other's keystrokes live.

<img src="/screenshots/tmux.png" alt="Terminal showing multiplayer tmux session with collaborative commands" style={{maxWidth: '800px'}} />

### How It Works

- Each worktree gets a dedicated tmux window in the shared `agor` session
- Multiple users connecting to the same worktree attach to the same window
- WebSocket broadcasting ensures all keystrokes and output are synchronized
- No configuration needed - works automatically when tmux is installed

### Use Cases

- **Pair programming** - Two developers working on the same feature in sync
- **Live debugging** - One person navigating terminal while another observes
- **Onboarding** - Senior dev demonstrates commands while junior follows along
- **Code review** - Reviewer can explore the worktree interactively during review

**Privacy Note:** Terminal sessions are worktree-scoped. Users only see terminals for worktrees they're actively using.
